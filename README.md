# Hardware-Based LP Decoding with ADMM
Source code for my master's thesis on hardware-based Linear Program (LP) decoding with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).
Here is relevant literature on the implementation.

This conference paper used an earlier non-pipelined version of parity polytope projection.

My thesis document.

There is both a conference paper and journal version of this in different stages of submission process. Will update in the future.
